<p align="center">
  <strong>An open-source Go reimplementation of the Claude Code AI coding agent.</strong><br/>
  We took the Claude Code architecture — the AI agent runtime that powers tool orchestration, session management, and prompt routing — and rebuilt every subsystem in Go. Then we went further: multi-model support, multi-agent orchestration, model fallback chains, IDE-level tooling, and a skills system. One binary, any LLM, instant startup.

## Why gocode Exists

Every great product starts with a simple observation.

Claude Code is a remarkable piece of engineering. The way it decomposes tool orchestration. The way it manages sessions. The way it routes prompts. The architecture is elegant. The ideas are right.

But the implementation carries weight it doesn't need. And it only works with Claude.

We asked two questions: **what if the best AI coding agent was also the fastest?** And **what if it worked with any model?**

Not a wrapper. Not a thin binding. A complete, ground-up reimplementation in Go — every registry, every scoring algorithm, every subsystem — enhanced with multi-model support, a standalone terminal agent, a production-grade MCP server, and native IDE integrations that the original never had.

gocode starts in under 10 milliseconds. It ships as a single 12MB binary. It works with Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Grok. You download it. You run it. That's it.

---

## Two Modes. One Binary.

gocode does something no other tool does: it's both a **standalone AI coding agent** and a **full MCP server** in a single 12MB binary.

| Mode | What It Does | How You Use It |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Agent Mode (TUI)** | Full terminal UI with split panels, diff viewer, streaming. Talk to any LLM. | `gocode chat` |
| **Agent Mode (REPL)** | Line-based chat for scripts and pipes. | `gocode chat --no-tui` |
| **API Server Mode** | Headless HTTP REST API for remote clients. | `gocode serve` |
| **MCP Server Mode** | Plug into Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, Antigravity, or Claude Desktop. | `gocode mcp-serve` |

You don't have to choose. You get both.

---

## What's New in v0.8.0

This changes everything. Again.

### 🌍 200+ Models. One Binary.

We ripped out the four-provider ceiling and replaced it with a universal model layer. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI — those are still native. But now DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, Together AI, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, and any local model running on Ollama or LM Studio just work. Set one env var. Pick a model. That's it.

> **[Full Model List →](docs/supported-models.md)**

### 🎯 Provider Launch Profiles

`gocode profile auto --goal coding` — scans your env vars, picks the best provider and model for your goal, saves it. `profile recommend` previews without saving. `profile init` creates a default. Your workflow, your rules.

### 🧠 Persistent Memory

Cross-session memory that survives between conversations. `/memory set preferred-lang Go` and it remembers forever. Injected into every system prompt automatically.

### 📋 Task Management

`/tasks add Fix the auth bug` — persistent task tracking across sessions. `/tasks list`, `/tasks done 1`. Stays on disk in `.gocode/tasks.json`.

### 💻 Codex Backend

Route through ChatGPT's Codex backend with auth from `~/.codex/auth.json`. `gocode chat --model codex` just works.

### 🔒 Runtime Hardening

`gocode smoke` — quick runtime smoke test. `gocode hardening` — checks file permissions, API key exposure in shell history, config security. `gocode doctor` now checks all 10 provider env vars plus Codex auth.

### 🌐 WebFetch & WebSearch Tools

Built-in web fetch and web search tools in the tool registry. The agent can browse the web without MCP.

### 📝 /commit with Co-Authored-By

`/commit` auto-generates commit messages and adds `Co-Authored-By: gocode` attribution.

### 🎯 Goal-Based Model Selection

`--goal coding` picks the best coding model. `--goal latency` picks the fastest. `--goal balanced` splits the difference. Works across all providers.

---

## What's in v0.7.0

We took the best ideas from Claude Code, OpenCode, and Claw Code — and built them all in Go. One binary. Every feature.

### 🖥 Full Terminal UI

A bubbletea-powered TUI launches by default. Split panels, colored diff viewer, mode switching, Go-themed design.

- Chat panel on the left, git diff viewer on the right (Ctrl+D to toggle)
- Tab to switch between Build mode (full access) and Plan mode (read-only)
- 4 built-in themes: `golang`, `monokai`, `dracula`, `nord`
- Custom themes via `.gocode/theme.json`

```bash
gocode chat --model sonnet              # TUI launches by default
gocode chat --model gpt5 --theme nord   # with Nord theme
gocode chat --no-tui                    # fall back to line-based REPL
```

### 🧠 It Never Stops

Model hits a rate limit? Falls through to the next in the chain. Context window full? Compacts and keeps going. API down? Exponential backoff, three retries, automatic recovery.

### 🤝 It Delegates

The orchestrator breaks complex tasks into pieces and hands them to specialists — a deep researcher, a planner, a debugger — each with its own model, context, and tool permissions. Up to five agents running in parallel.

### 🔧 IDE-Level Tools + Auto-Format

LSP integration, AST-grep, tmux sessions, MCP client. Plus auto-format after every edit — gofmt, prettier, black, rustfmt.

### 🌐 HTTP API Server + Remote Access

```bash
gocode serve --addr :3000           # headless API server
gocode auth generate my-phone       # secure remote access
```

### 🖼 Multimodal Input

Include an image path in your message — it gets base64-encoded and sent as vision input. Works in both REPL and TUI.

### 📋 21 Slash Commands

`/help` `/exit` `/clear` `/compact` `/cost` `/model` `/skill` `/plan` `/init-deep` `/diff` `/undo` `/redo` `/status` `/review` `/permissions` `/doctor` `/connect` `/share` `/commit` `/memory` `/tasks`

### 🔧 CLI Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `gocode serve` | Headless HTTP API server |
| `gocode stats` | Usage statistics across all sessions |
| `gocode export/import` | Session import/export |
| `gocode pr` | Create GitHub PR via `gh` CLI |
| `gocode github` | List GitHub issues via `gh` CLI |
| `gocode auth` | Manage remote access keys |
| `gocode profile` | Launch profiles — init, auto, recommend, show |
| `gocode doctor` | Environment check (10 providers + Codex auth) |
| `gocode smoke` | Quick runtime smoke test |
| `gocode hardening` | Security and permissions audit |
| `gocode config` | Show current runtime configuration |

## Skills — Expertise on Demand

Here's the thing about coding agents: they're generalists. They know a little about everything and a lot about nothing. That's fine for "add a comment to line 42." It's not fine for "build me a pixel-perfect clone of this website" or "refactor this Go codebase to follow idiomatic error handling."

Skills change that. One flag, and your agent becomes a specialist.

```bash
gocode chat --skill golang-best-practices    # now it writes Go like a senior engineer
gocode chat --skill nothing-design           # now it designs like Teenage Engineering
gocode chat --skill clone-website            # now it reverse-engineers websites
```

Or switch mid-session:

```
you> /skill react-best-practices
Skill react-best-practices activated.
you> review this component for performance issues
```

### 8 Built-in Skills

| Skill | What It Does | Activate With |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `git-master` | Atomic commits, interactive rebase, clean history | `--skill git-master` |
| `frontend-ui-ux` | Design-first UI development, accessibility, semantic HTML | `--skill frontend-ui-ux` |
| `nothing-design` | Nothing-inspired monochrome design system. Swiss typography, OLED blacks, mechanical precision. | `--skill nothing-design` |
| `golang-best-practices` | Idiomatic Go — code style, error handling, testing patterns, naming conventions | `--skill golang-best-practices` |
| `clone-website` | Pixel-perfect website cloning. Extract CSS, download assets, rebuild in Next.js. | `--skill clone-website` |
| `nextjs-best-practices` | Next.js 15+ patterns — RSC boundaries, async APIs, data fetching, route handlers | `--skill nextjs-best-practices` |
| `react-best-practices` | React performance optimization — eliminate waterfalls, bundle size, re-render patterns | `--skill react-best-practices` |
| `web-design-guidelines` | Accessibility audit, responsive design, interaction states, WCAG compliance | `--skill web-design-guidelines` |

### Create Your Own

Drop a JSON file in `.gocode/skills/`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-skill",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert in...",
  "tool_permissions": ["bashtool", "filereadtool", "fileedittool"]
}
```

It loads automatically on next startup.

## What Can gocode Do?

### As a Standalone Agent (`gocode chat` / `gocode prompt`)

- 🤖 **Autonomous coding** — reads your codebase, writes code, runs tests, fixes bugs
- 🔄 **Multi-turn tool loops** — Claude/GPT/Gemini calls tools, gets results, keeps going until done
- 🌊 **Real-time streaming** — see tokens as they arrive, not after the model finishes thinking
- 🔐 **Permission system** — asks before running dangerous commands
- 💰 **Token tracking** — `/cost` shows exactly how many tokens you've used
- 📝 **Session persistence** — resume conversations with `--resume`
- 🔀 **Model switching** — `--model gpt4o` today, `--model sonnet` tomorrow, same agent
- 🛡 **Hash-anchored edits** — content hashes prevent stale overwrites (`--hashline`)
- 🔁 **Model fallback** — automatic failover across providers on rate limits and errors
- 🧠 **Multi-agent orchestration** — delegate to specialist sub-agents running in parallel
- 📋 **Planning mode** — `/plan` runs an interview before any code is touched
- 🎯 **Skills system** — domain-tuned agent profiles from `.gocode/skills/`
- 🔬 **LSP integration** — real renames, go-to-definition, find-references via language servers
- 🌳 **AST-grep** — structural code search and rewrite, not regex
- 💻 **Tmux sessions** — persistent terminal sessions for REPLs and debuggers
- 🔌 **MCP client** — connect to external MCP servers for web search, docs, code search
- 📚 **Auto-context** — `/init-deep` generates project-wide AGENTS.md context files
- 🖥 **Full TUI** — bubbletea terminal UI with split panels, diff viewer, themes
- 🖼 **Multimodal** — send images inline with your messages
- 🌐 **HTTP API** — `gocode serve` for remote access from any client
- 🔑 **Auth keys** — secure remote access with `gocode auth generate`
- 🎨 **Themes** — golang, monokai, dracula, nord (or custom via JSON)
- ✨ **Auto-format** — gofmt, prettier, black, rustfmt after every edit
- 📊 **GitHub integration** — `gocode pr` and `gocode github` via gh CLI

### As an MCP Server (`gocode mcp-serve`)

- 🔌 **14 production tools** — shell, file I/O, grep, glob, workspace analysis
- 💻 **5 IDEs supported** — Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, Antigravity, Claude Desktop
- 🌐 **Dual transport** — stdio for IDEs, HTTP for anything else
- 📋 **Full MCP compliance** — initialize, tools/list, tools/call, ping, resources/list
