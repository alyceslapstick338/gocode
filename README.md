<h1 align="center">gocode — Claude Code, Rewritten in Go. Now Multi-Model.</h1>

<h3 align="center">The Go version of Claude Code. One binary. Zero dependencies. 20× faster.<br/>Now with multi-agent orchestration, model fallback, and IDE-level tools — from your terminal.</h3>

<p align="center">
  <strong>An open-source Go reimplementation of the Claude Code AI coding agent.</strong><br/>
  We took the Claude Code architecture — the AI agent runtime that powers tool orchestration, session management, and prompt routing — and rebuilt every subsystem in Go. Then we went further: multi-model support, multi-agent orchestration, model fallback chains, IDE-level tooling, and a skills system. One binary, any LLM, instant startup.

## Why gocode Exists

Every great product starts with a simple observation.

Claude Code is a remarkable piece of engineering. The way it decomposes tool orchestration. The way it manages sessions. The way it routes prompts. The architecture is elegant. The ideas are right.

But the implementation carries weight it doesn't need. And it only works with Claude.

We asked two questions: **what if the best AI coding agent was also the fastest?** And **what if it worked with any model?**

Not a wrapper. Not a thin binding. A complete, ground-up reimplementation in Go — every registry, every scoring algorithm, every subsystem — enhanced with multi-model support, a standalone terminal agent, a production-grade MCP server, and native IDE integrations that the original never had.

gocode starts in under 10 milliseconds. It ships as a single 12MB binary. It works with Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Grok. You download it. You run it. That's it.

---

## Two Modes. One Binary.

gocode does something no other tool does: it's both a **standalone AI coding agent** and a **full MCP server** in a single 12MB binary.

| Mode | What It Does | How You Use It |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Agent Mode (TUI)** | Full terminal UI with split panels, diff viewer, streaming. Talk to any LLM. | `gocode chat` |
| **Agent Mode (REPL)** | Line-based chat for scripts and pipes. | `gocode chat --no-tui` |
| **API Server Mode** | Headless HTTP REST API for remote clients. | `gocode serve` |
| **MCP Server Mode** | Plug into Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, Antigravity, or Claude Desktop. | `gocode mcp-serve` |

You don't have to choose. You get both.

---

## What's New in v0.3.0 — The Agent OS

We didn't just add features. We changed what a terminal agent can be.

Most coding agents are single-threaded, single-model, and fragile. They crash when the context window fills up. They stop when the API rate-limits. They can't delegate. They can't plan. They can't talk to your language server.

gocode v0.3.0 fixes all of that.

### 🧠 It Never Stops

Your primary model hits a rate limit? gocode silently falls through to the next model in the chain. Context window full? It compacts the conversation and keeps going. API down? Exponential backoff, three retries, automatic recovery. You keep working. The agent keeps working.

### 🤝 It Delegates

One agent is a tool. A team of agents is a workforce. The orchestrator breaks complex tasks into pieces and hands them to specialists — a deep researcher, a planner, a debugger — each with its own model, its own context, its own tool permissions. Up to five agents running in parallel, results flowing back through Go channels.

### 📋 It Plans Before It Codes

Type `/plan` and the agent interviews you. What's the scope? What are the constraints? What could go wrong? It produces a structured plan — summary, ambiguities, steps, estimated scope — and waits for your approval before touching a single file.

### 🔧 It Has IDE-Level Tools

LSP integration for real renames and go-to-definition. AST-grep for structural code search. Tmux for persistent terminal sessions. MCP client for connecting to any external tool server. These aren't wrappers around grep. These are the real thing.

### 📚 It Understands Your Project

Type `/init-deep` and gocode scans your entire project, generating `AGENTS.md` context files in every directory. From that point on, every file the agent reads comes with automatic project context. No manual configuration. No prompt engineering. It just knows.

## What's New in v0.6 — The Terminal OS

We looked at what OpenCode and Claw Code built. Then we built it all in Go. In one binary.

### 🖥 Full Terminal UI

gocode now ships with a bubbletea-powered TUI — not a line-based REPL, a real terminal application. Split panels, colored diff viewer, mode switching, Go-themed design. It launches by default.

- Chat panel on the left, git diff viewer on the right (Ctrl+D to toggle)
- Tab to switch between Build mode (full access) and Plan mode (read-only)
- Go-themed colors: gopher blue header, teal prompts, pink errors
- 4 built-in themes: `golang`, `monokai`, `dracula`, `nord`

```bash
gocode chat --model sonnet              # TUI launches by default
gocode chat --model gpt5 --theme nord   # with Nord theme
gocode chat --no-tui                    # fall back to line-based REPL
```

### 🌐 HTTP API Server

Run gocode as a headless server. Any client — web, mobile, IDE plugin — can connect.

```bash
gocode serve --addr :3000
# POST /v1/chat, GET /v1/status, GET /v1/health
```

### 🔑 Remote Access with Auth Keys

Generate, list, and delete API keys for secure remote access:

```bash
gocode auth generate my-phone
gocode auth list
gocode auth delete <id>
```

When keys exist, `gocode serve` requires `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on all endpoints.

### 🖼 Multimodal Input

Include an image path in your message — it gets base64-encoded and sent as vision input:

```
you> describe this screenshot.png
```

Supports `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`. Works in both REPL and TUI.

### 🔧 More CLI Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `gocode serve` | Headless HTTP API server |
| `gocode stats` | Usage statistics across all sessions |
| `gocode export <id>` | Export session JSON |
| `gocode import <file>` | Import session JSON |
| `gocode pr` | Create GitHub PR via `gh` CLI |
| `gocode github` | List GitHub issues via `gh` CLI |
| `gocode auth generate/list/delete` | Manage remote access keys |

### 📝 18 Slash Commands

`/help` `/exit` `/clear` `/compact` `/cost` `/model` `/skill` `/plan` `/init-deep` `/diff` `/undo` `/redo` `/status` `/review` `/permissions` `/doctor` `/connect` `/share`

### ⚡ Auto-Format After Edits

When the agent edits a file, gocode automatically runs the appropriate formatter:
- `.go` → `gofmt` / `goimports`
- `.js/.ts` → `prettier`
- `.py` → `black`
- `.rs` → `rustfmt`

## Skills — Expertise on Demand

Here's the thing about coding agents: they're generalists. They know a little about everything and a lot about nothing. That's fine for "add a comment to line 42." It's not fine for "build me a pixel-perfect clone of this website" or "refactor this Go codebase to follow idiomatic error handling."

Skills change that. One flag, and your agent becomes a specialist.

```bash
gocode chat --skill golang-best-practices    # now it writes Go like a senior engineer
gocode chat --skill nothing-design           # now it designs like Teenage Engineering
gocode chat --skill clone-website            # now it reverse-engineers websites
```

Or switch mid-session:

```
you> /skill react-best-practices
Skill react-best-practices activated.
you> review this component for performance issues
```

### 8 Built-in Skills

| Skill | What It Does | Activate With |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `git-master` | Atomic commits, interactive rebase, clean history | `--skill git-master` |
| `frontend-ui-ux` | Design-first UI development, accessibility, semantic HTML | `--skill frontend-ui-ux` |
| `nothing-design` | Nothing-inspired monochrome design system. Swiss typography, OLED blacks, mechanical precision. | `--skill nothing-design` |
| `golang-best-practices` | Idiomatic Go — code style, error handling, testing patterns, naming conventions | `--skill golang-best-practices` |
| `clone-website` | Pixel-perfect website cloning. Extract CSS, download assets, rebuild in Next.js. | `--skill clone-website` |
| `nextjs-best-practices` | Next.js 15+ patterns — RSC boundaries, async APIs, data fetching, route handlers | `--skill nextjs-best-practices` |
| `react-best-practices` | React performance optimization — eliminate waterfalls, bundle size, re-render patterns | `--skill react-best-practices` |
| `web-design-guidelines` | Accessibility audit, responsive design, interaction states, WCAG compliance | `--skill web-design-guidelines` |

### Create Your Own

Drop a JSON file in `.gocode/skills/`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-skill",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert in...",
  "tool_permissions": ["bashtool", "filereadtool", "fileedittool"]
}
```

It loads automatically on next startup.

## What Can gocode Do?

### As a Standalone Agent (`gocode chat` / `gocode prompt`)

- 🤖 **Autonomous coding** — reads your codebase, writes code, runs tests, fixes bugs
- 🔄 **Multi-turn tool loops** — Claude/GPT/Gemini calls tools, gets results, keeps going until done
- 🌊 **Real-time streaming** — see tokens as they arrive, not after the model finishes thinking
- 🔐 **Permission system** — asks before running dangerous commands
- 💰 **Token tracking** — `/cost` shows exactly how many tokens you've used
- 📝 **Session persistence** — resume conversations with `--resume`
- 🔀 **Model switching** — `--model gpt4o` today, `--model sonnet` tomorrow, same agent
- 🛡 **Hash-anchored edits** — content hashes prevent stale overwrites (`--hashline`)
- 🔁 **Model fallback** — automatic failover across providers on rate limits and errors
- 🧠 **Multi-agent orchestration** — delegate to specialist sub-agents running in parallel
- 📋 **Planning mode** — `/plan` runs an interview before any code is touched
- 🎯 **Skills system** — domain-tuned agent profiles from `.gocode/skills/`
- 🔬 **LSP integration** — real renames, go-to-definition, find-references via language servers
- 🌳 **AST-grep** — structural code search and rewrite, not regex
- 💻 **Tmux sessions** — persistent terminal sessions for REPLs and debuggers
- 🔌 **MCP client** — connect to external MCP servers for web search, docs, code search
- 📚 **Auto-context** — `/init-deep` generates project-wide AGENTS.md context files
- 🖥 **Full TUI** — bubbletea terminal UI with split panels, diff viewer, themes
- 🖼 **Multimodal** — send images inline with your messages
- 🌐 **HTTP API** — `gocode serve` for remote access from any client
- 🔑 **Auth keys** — secure remote access with `gocode auth generate`
- 🎨 **Themes** — golang, monokai, dracula, nord (or custom via JSON)
- ✨ **Auto-format** — gofmt, prettier, black, rustfmt after every edit
- 📊 **GitHub integration** — `gocode pr` and `gocode github` via gh CLI

### As an MCP Server (`gocode mcp-serve`)

- 🔌 **14 production tools** — shell, file I/O, grep, glob, workspace analysis
- 💻 **5 IDEs supported** — Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, Antigravity, Claude Desktop
- 🌐 **Dual transport** — stdio for IDEs, HTTP for anything else
- 📋 **Full MCP compliance** — initialize, tools/list, tools/call, ping, resources/list
