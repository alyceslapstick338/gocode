<h1 align="center">gocode — Claude Code, Rewritten in Go. Now Multi-Model.</h1>

<h3 align="center">The Go version of Claude Code. One binary. Zero dependencies. 20× faster.<br/>Now with multi-agent orchestration, model fallback, and IDE-level tools — from your terminal.</h3>

<p align="center">
  <strong>An open-source Go reimplementation of the Claude Code AI coding agent.</strong><br/>
  We took the Claude Code architecture — the AI agent runtime that powers tool orchestration, session management, and prompt routing — and rebuilt every subsystem in Go. Then we went further: multi-model support, multi-agent orchestration, model fallback chains, IDE-level tooling, and a skills system. One binary, any LLM, instant startup.

## Why gocode Exists

Every great product starts with a simple observation.

Claude Code is a remarkable piece of engineering. The way it decomposes tool orchestration. The way it manages sessions. The way it routes prompts. The architecture is elegant. The ideas are right.

But the implementation carries weight it doesn't need. And it only works with Claude.

We asked two questions: **what if the best AI coding agent was also the fastest?** And **what if it worked with any model?**

Not a wrapper. Not a thin binding. A complete, ground-up reimplementation in Go — every registry, every scoring algorithm, every subsystem — enhanced with multi-model support, a standalone terminal agent, a production-grade MCP server, and native IDE integrations that the original never had.

gocode starts in under 10 milliseconds. It ships as a single 12MB binary. It works with Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Grok. You download it. You run it. That's it.

## Two Modes. One Binary.

gocode does something no other tool does: it's both a **standalone AI coding agent** and a **full MCP server** in a single 12MB binary.

| Mode | What It Does | How You Use It |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Agent Mode** | Talk to any LLM directly from your terminal. It reads files, runs commands, edits code — autonomously. | `gocode chat` or `gocode prompt "..."` |
| **MCP Server Mode** | Plug into Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, Antigravity, or Claude Desktop as a tool server. | `gocode mcp-serve` |

You don't have to choose. You get both.

## What's New in v0.3.0 — The Agent OS

We didn't just add features. We changed what a terminal agent can be.

Most coding agents are single-threaded, single-model, and fragile. They crash when the context window fills up. They stop when the API rate-limits. They can't delegate. They can't plan. They can't talk to your language server.

gocode v0.3.0 fixes all of that.

### 🧠 It Never Stops

Your primary model hits a rate limit? gocode silently falls through to the next model in the chain. Context window full? It compacts the conversation and keeps going. API down? Exponential backoff, three retries, automatic recovery. You keep working. The agent keeps working.

### 🤝 It Delegates

One agent is a tool. A team of agents is a workforce. The orchestrator breaks complex tasks into pieces and hands them to specialists — a deep researcher, a planner, a debugger — each with its own model, its own context, its own tool permissions. Up to five agents running in parallel, results flowing back through Go channels.

### 📋 It Plans Before It Codes

Type `/plan` and the agent interviews you. What's the scope? What are the constraints? What could go wrong? It produces a structured plan — summary, ambiguities, steps, estimated scope — and waits for your approval before touching a single file.

### 🔧 It Has IDE-Level Tools

LSP integration for real renames and go-to-definition. AST-grep for structural code search. Tmux for persistent terminal sessions. MCP client for connecting to any external tool server. These aren't wrappers around grep. These are the real thing.

### 📚 It Understands Your Project

Type `/init-deep` and gocode scans your entire project, generating `AGENTS.md` context files in every directory. From that point on, every file the agent reads comes with automatic project context. No manual configuration. No prompt engineering. It just knows.

## Supported Models

Use any of these out of the box. Just set the right API key and go.

| Provider | Models | Alias | Env Var |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4, Haiku 4.5 | `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o3, o4-mini, Codex | `gpt4o`, `gpt4-mini`, `o1`, `o3`, `o4-mini`, `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Google** | Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash | `gemini`, `gemini-pro`, `gemini-flash` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| **xAI** | Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, Grok 2 | `grok`, `grok-mini`, `grok-2` | `XAI_API_KEY` |

Or pass any full model ID: `--model gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, `--model claude-sonnet-4-6`, etc.

## Quickstart — 60 Seconds to Your First Agent Session

```bash
# 1. Install
go install github.com/AlleyBo55/gocode/cmd/gocode@latest

# 2. Set your API key (pick your provider)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...    # Claude
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # GPT-4o
export GEMINI_API_KEY=AI...            # Gemini
export XAI_API_KEY=xai-...             # Grok

# 3. Chat
gocode chat

# Or run a one-shot prompt
gocode prompt "find all TODO comments in this project and list them"
```

That's it. No Python. No Node. No virtual environments. No config files. One binary, one env var, go.

## What Can gocode Do?

### As a Standalone Agent (`gocode chat` / `gocode prompt`)

- 🤖 **Autonomous coding** — reads your codebase, writes code, runs tests, fixes bugs
- 🔄 **Multi-turn tool loops** — Claude/GPT/Gemini calls tools, gets results, keeps going until done
- 🌊 **Real-time streaming** — see tokens as they arrive, not after the model finishes thinking
- 🔐 **Permission system** — asks before running dangerous commands
- 💰 **Token tracking** — `/cost` shows exactly how many tokens you've used
- 📝 **Session persistence** — resume conversations with `--resume`
- 🔀 **Model switching** — `--model gpt4o` today, `--model sonnet` tomorrow, same agent
- 🛡 **Hash-anchored edits** — content hashes prevent stale overwrites (`--hashline`)
- 🔁 **Model fallback** — automatic failover across providers on rate limits and errors
- 🧠 **Multi-agent orchestration** — delegate to specialist sub-agents running in parallel
- 📋 **Planning mode** — `/plan` runs an interview before any code is touched
- 🎯 **Skills system** — domain-tuned agent profiles from `.gocode/skills/`
- 🔬 **LSP integration** — real renames, go-to-definition, find-references via language servers
- 🌳 **AST-grep** — structural code search and rewrite, not regex
- 💻 **Tmux sessions** — persistent terminal sessions for REPLs and debuggers
- 🔌 **MCP client** — connect to external MCP servers for web search, docs, code search
- 📚 **Auto-context** — `/init-deep` generates project-wide AGENTS.md context files

### As an MCP Server (`gocode mcp-serve`)

- 🔌 **14 production tools** — shell, file I/O, grep, glob, workspace analysis
- 💻 **5 IDEs supported** — Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, Antigravity, Claude Desktop
- 🌐 **Dual transport** — stdio for IDEs, HTTP for anything else
- 📋 **Full MCP compliance** — initialize, tools/list, tools/call, ping, resources/list
